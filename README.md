# Mermaid-DDOS
## Description
- In this sequence diagram, the attacker sends a command to the bots in the BotNet to start the DDoS attack. The bots then flood the WebServer with too many requests. The WebServer detects the high traffic and alerts the Firewall. The Firewall blocks suspicious IP addresses to reduce the attack. Finally, the WebServer responds to the bots with an error message because it canâ€™t handle the overload.
